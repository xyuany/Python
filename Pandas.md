## Time Series / Date functionality

All materials come from official tutorial [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.19/timeseries.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.19/timeseries.html)

Using the NumPy `datetime64` and `timedelta64` dtypes, we have consolidated a large number of features from other Python libraries like `scikits.timeseries` as well as created a tremendous amount of new functionality for manipulating time series data.

`pandas.to_datetime()` covert string type to date series
`df.drop()` to remove labelled axis
